3. **Mix long and short** - Don't do only 8-hour tasks; mix in quick wins for momentum
4. **Track your time** - Compare estimates to actual time to improve planning
5. **Update as you go** - Mark tasks complete immediately, don't batch
6. **Ask for help** - If stuck >1 hour, reach out to team
7. **Celebrate wins** - Check off completed tasks and recognize progress
